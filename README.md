# SPECIAL NOTE

**No files from Advanced VR Framework have been included with this repo.**

# Special Requests
We would be happy to take some requests. Please keep in mind that this is done in our spare time to help out the community and we are not involved with the AVRF project so it might be a bit before we can get to your request. We will consider making as many examples as we can with the time we can spare away from our own project :)
